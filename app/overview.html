The Wyatt Lab at Ohio University leverages bioinformatics--the 
interface of molecular biology and computer science--to study the 
complex signaling events that allow plants to respond to gravity. 
This research heavily involves next generation sequencing technology 
to analyze DNA to discover new information about the expression and 
function of genes. Next generation sequencing can generate millions 
or billions of DNA sequences in a single run creating massive datasets. 
Deriving meaning from this data requires computational and biological 
expertise as well as a significant investment of time to interpret results. 
This is where the use of bioinformatics becomes necessary to save both 
time and labor.  One area with especially poorly developed tools is the 
analysis of DNA sequencing data produced by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation 
experiments (experiments examining the DNA sequences bound by a specific 
protein). Analysis of Replicated CHIPseq (ARC) use the reference genome 
fasta file and generates a general feature format (gff) file providing 
unique identifiers for each region on each chromosome in the reference 
genome. ARC will then align the experimental sequence reads to the reference 
genome and bin them by the newly generated regions.  Finally, it will generate 
differential binding profiles to provide the user with output data identifying 
likely DNA binding sites for the protein of interest.  It will also have a 
helper function where the fasta files are first formatted to ensure the program 
can read them, as well as a few optional features to optimize end-user experience 
and allow users to customize essential parameters. ARC is implemented with python 
in a Flask web application to make it simple and easy for anyone to use. HARC will 
be beta tested by analyzing CHIPseq data from 3 transcription factors (DNA binding 
proteins regulating gene expression) that have been previously identified through 
NASA research in The Wyatt Lab.  This research was supported by the Program to Aid 
Career Exploration (PACE) at Ohio University.
